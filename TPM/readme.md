The flowchart above illustrates the step-by-step process and tools used for RNA-seq data analysis in gene expression analysis. It visually represents each processing stage, including data cleaning with Fastp and Trim Galore!, quantification of data quality with FastQC, and transcript quantification with Salmon. This image can be a useful guide for understanding the gene expression analysis process.
